      'My son Benjamin looks forward to every session with Hazirah. As he improves, we work closely with Alex and Haz to stretch the syllabus and each time, it’s such a joy to see Benjamin respond positively. As he enters Pri 1, we believe that together with Nurture Pods, he will continue to enjoy and grow to the best of his ability.',

      'High quality shadow teachers who are patient, positive and encouraging towards my child. They make use of different strategies such as visual aids, social stories and setting up reward system to help motivate my child. Daily updates with parents and frequent communication with subject Teachers is also a plus point. Thank you, Alex, for checking in regularly and making trips down to the school to ensure that my child is well taken care of by the shadow teacher.',
